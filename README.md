Rosie's remote control door project

My daughter (9 years old) saw an ad for "Sesame" and she thought it was cool.

I didn't think it was *that* cool - so we're just going to build a small scale one with Swift and a pile of arduino bits.

This is her learning to code, and her dad learning how to teach programming.
